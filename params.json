  "body": "##About Alloy\r\nAlloy is a UH student-built tool to help members of the UH iLab and sPACE communities find projects and find people for projects of their own. Have an idea for a project that would look good on your resume? Want to do your own custom senior project? Or do you just want experiment and learn something new with other students who just want to do the same?\r\n\r\nLet Alloy help you find a team that's right for what you want.\r\n\r\n##Key Features\r\n* Create profiles that list your skills, interests and availability (TODO)\r\n* Create projects that other people can browse and join (TODO)\r\n* Search for people based on skills (TODO)\r\n* Follow people you want to work with to track their projects (TODO)\r\n* Set up alerts for projects that might interest you (TODO)\r\n\r\nAlloy is a work in progress, but you can view the current version of the site [here](http://alloytestdeployrv.meteorapp.com/).\r\n\r\n[Milestone 1](https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy/projects/1)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 2](https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy/projects/2)\r\n\r\n\r\n#User Guide\r\n##Landing Page\r\nWhen you first log in, you'll notice that there are several projects featured / suggested to you. Our basic suggestion system is not yet hooked up, but will be ready very soon.\r\n\r\n##My Profile\r\n\tOn your generated profile page, there are several menu tabs in the top left. Each tab shows different content that are currently just placeholders.\r\n\tScrolling down your profile page, you'll find an unformatted table of dynamically loaded content specific to your profile. You'll notice that you are already a part of a project called \"The Null Project.\" This is a project that all users are automatically entered in and is currently used for debugging purposes.\r\n\tIf you click the associated orange button, you will see a message confirming that you are already a part of the project. Clicking the blue button takes you to the project's home page.\r\n\tScrolling down further on the MyProfile page takes you to another table containing a single project called \"joinableNullProject.\" Clicking the orange button here sends a request to admins of the project that you would like to join. Clicking the blue button to get to the joinableNullProject's home page, you will see your request near the bottom of the page. This list will later be private to non-admins of the project, but for now, to get a feel for how the functionality will work, you can click the yellow button to add yourself and other users to the project.\r\n\tNavigate back to \"TheNullProject\" home page through the blue button back on the MyProfile pageâ€¦\r\n\r\n##Project Page\r\n\tHere on the project profile page, we can see information about the project and, because we are all admins, we can edit this project's profile by clicking the \"edit project info\" button on the left.\r\n\tHere we can edit the presented fields and saved changes will be reflected in the project's profile page. Note that in the skills wanted section, skills can be multiple words and each skills is separated by commas (rather than hitting 'enter' after typing each skill).\r\n\r\n##Create Project\r\n\tThis page can be accessed from the header menu bar. It is similar to the \"edit project info\" functionality, except here we can create new projects rather than edit existing info. Note that although the \"Skills Wanted\" section provides a list of suggested skills, like in the \"edit project info\" page, you can enter any phrase that does not contain a comma. Any new skills and phrases you enter will be saved and possibly suggested in the \"Skills Wanted\" dropdown menu the next time a user creates a project.\r\n\r\n##Search\r\n\tThis page can be accessed from the header menu bar. This page can be used to search for projects and users based on skills wanted and skills available, respectively. Currently, the search terms must be exact word matches and the search results must be cleared each time with the \"clear\" button. \r\n\r\n\r\n#Developer Guide\r\n\r\n#Screenshots\r\n##Public Landing Page\r\n![landing page](/doc/AlloyM1Homepage.png)\r\n##Add Project\r\n![user home page](/doc/AlloyM1AddProject.png)\r\n##Edit Project\r\n![user profile](/doc/AlloyM1EditProject.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
