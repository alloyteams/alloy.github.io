  "body": "##About Alloy\r\nAlloy is a UH student-built tool to help members of the UH iLab and sPACE communities find projects and find people for projects of their own. Have an idea for a project that would look good on your resume? Want to do your own custom senior project? Or do you just want experiment and learn something new with other students who just want to do the same?\r\n\r\nLet Alloy help you find a team that's right for what you want.\r\n\r\n##Key Features\r\n* Create profiles that list your skills, interests and availability (TODO)\r\n* Create projects that other people can browse and join (TODO)\r\n* Search for people based on skills (TODO)\r\n* Follow people you want to work with to track their projects (TODO)\r\n* Set up alerts for projects that might interest you (TODO)\r\n\r\nAlloy is a work in progress, but you can view the current version of the site [here](http://alloytestdeployrv.meteorapp.com/).\r\n\r\n[Milestone 1](https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy/projects/1)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 2](https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy/projects/2)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 3](https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy/projects/3)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Guided Tour\r\n##Landing Page\r\nWhen you first log in, you'll notice that there are several projects featured / suggested to you. These matches are based on the skills you've listed in your profile. If you don't see any projects, Alloy will ask you to update your skills so we can connect you with some projects that might interest you. When logged in, you will also see a list of notifications.\r\n\r\n![](/doc/landing-page-logged-in-final.png)\r\n\r\n##My Profile\r\nYou will have a user profile where you can write a short bio about yourself, list your skills and see all of the projects you are currently a part of. The current profile picture is just a placeholder and cannot be updated yet.\r\n\r\n![](/doc/user-profile-final.png)\r\n\r\nIf you click the associated orange button, you will see a message confirming that you are already a part of the project. Clicking the blue button takes you to the project's home page.\r\n\r\nScrolling down further on the MyProfile page takes you to another table containing a single project called \"joinableNullProject.\" Clicking the orange button here sends a request to admins of the project that you would like to join. Clicking the blue button to get to the joinableNullProject's home page, you will see your request near the bottom of the page. This list will later be private to non-admins of the project, but for now, to get a feel for how the functionality will work, you can click the yellow button to add yourself and other users to the project.\r\n\r\n![](/doc/project-request.png)\r\n\r\nClick on any of the projects on your page to see more information about them...\r\n\r\n##Project Page\r\nHere on the project profile page, we can see information about the project. As a project administrator, we can edit the information abut the project, manage members and accept or decline requests to join the project. \r\n\r\n![](/doc/profject-profile-final.png)\r\n\r\nBy clicking on the \"Edit Project Info\" button, we can edit the presented fields and saved changes will be reflected in the project's profile page. Warning, for now, changing the name messes with how Alloy associates users with the projects they are a part of, so avoid changing this for now. Note that in the skills wanted section, skills can be multiple words and each skill is separated by commas (rather than hitting 'enter' after typing each skill).\r\n\r\n![](/doc/project-edit.png)\r\n\r\n##Create Project\r\nWant to create your own project and start building your own team? The project creation page can be accessed from the header menu bar. It is similar to the \"edit project info\" functionality, except here we can create new projects rather than edit existing info. Note that although the \"Skills Wanted\" section provides a list of suggested skills, like in the \"edit project info\" page, you can enter any phrase that does not contain a comma. Any new skills and phrases you enter will be saved and possibly suggested in the \"Skills Wanted\" dropdown menu the next time a user creates a project.\r\n\r\n##Search\r\nThis page can be accessed from the header menu bar. This page can be used to search for projects and users based on skills wanted and skills available, respectively. Currently, the search terms must be exact word matches.\r\n\r\n![](/doc/search-projects.png)      \r\n\r\n\r\n#Developers Guide\r\n* To begin working on Alloy, meteor must be installed on your machine.\r\n* Create a directory to hold the project\r\n* git clone the project to your machine with\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy.git\r\n```\r\n* From this directory, run\r\n```\r\nmeteor npm install\r\nmeteor â€”settings ../config/settings.development.json\r\n```\r\n* Test that Alloy is running on localhost:3000 from any browser\r\n\r\nYou can then use the editor of your choice to begin modifying Alloy's files. Note that Alloy uses the coding style preferences described [this](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/development-environments/ics-se-code-style.xml) xml file.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of the project structure, it is helpful to note that Alloy is based on the meteor-application-template available [here](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/)  \r\n\r\n#Contributors\r\n* [Timothy Byers](https://byerst.github.io/)\r\n* [Allie Kim](https://alliekim.github.io/)\r\n* [Neil Teves](https://neilnthings.github.io/)\r\n* [Reed Villanueva](https://reedv.github.io/)\r\n* [Ed White](https://spyhi.github.io/)\r\n\r\n#Screenshots\r\n##Public Landing Page\r\n![landing page](/doc/landing-page.png)\r\n##Add Project\r\n![user home page](/doc/AlloyM1AddProject.png)\r\n##Edit Project\r\n![user profile](/doc/AlloyM1EditProject.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
