Or do you just want experiment and learn something new with other students who just want to do the same?

##Home Page
When you're logged in, the home page will populate the top menu with your options and switch to displaying suggested projects, which are populated based on the skills you list in the user profile. This is also where you'll see alerts for relevant activity on the site, such as requests to join your project!

##Create Project
You can create a project by clicking "Create Project" in the menu bar, and filling out the form. The skills are very important, since that's what users will search for, and how your projects will get suggested to other users!

##Project Page
The project page changes based on your relationship to it, and you can see your options below the project image. For example, if you're logged out, you can only see the title, bio, and featured image, along with a prompt to log in.

If you're logged in, but aren't a member of the project, you can make a request to join via the button that appears below the featured image.

#Developers Guide
* To begin working on Alloy, meteor must be installed on your machine.
* Create a directory to hold the project
* git clone the project to your machine with
```
git clone https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy.git
```
* From this directory, run
```
meteor npm install
meteor â€”settings ../config/settings.development.json
```
* Test that Alloy is running on localhost:3000 from any browser

You can then use the editor of your choice to begin modifying Alloy's files. Note that Alloy uses the coding style preferences described [this](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/development-environments/ics-se-code-style.xml) xml file.

To get an idea of the project structure, it is helpful to note that Alloy is based on the meteor-application-template available [here](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/)
